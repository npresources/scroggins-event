# Scroggins Event

This is the event page for the Clay Scroggins live event.

## Deployment

1. Upload the contents of this directory to `event.clayscroggins.com`

This will allow Akamai to pick up everything that exists on the server and host it from the CDN.

## Notes

This is essentially a microsite that looks like it's part of the Clay Scroggins website but is really
a standalone site hosted elsewhere.
